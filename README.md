# WeatherPy

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to help Jack improve the PlanMyTrip app. We helped improve the application by adding weather descriptions to the date we retrieved. The Beta testers can use the app and filter locations by temperature. For example if they want to travel to a cold place they can make the Fahrenheit filters be low and vice versa. The app also helps you find nearby hotels and also create travel routes between destinations using the Google Maps Directions API.
